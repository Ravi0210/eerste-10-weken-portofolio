# <h1> Looks bad to be honest </h1>

In first few weeks in school we learned html and css. And to close our first period we had to put all our experience in to one project. This is was very hard for me at the time. Because with 0 designing background and below average knowledge about html and css. This project was a huge failure, it has multiple designs and not functional. It looks very ugly because there are multiple colors that don't mix well. I currently don't have any plans for this project but I might do some funky stuff with this later!
